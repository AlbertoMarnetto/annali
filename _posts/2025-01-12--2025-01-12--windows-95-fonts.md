Windows 95 and a Bizarre Case of Font Drag and Drop
</h2>
<p class="post-subtitle"> 
or: A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again 
</p>

About twenty-seven years ago I discovered a quirk in Windows 95 (and 98). To my knowledge, it has never been published. Well, it's never too late.

### The benign variant

</a>
<figcaption>4. After a refresh (F5), all labels are using the new font.</figcaption>
</center>

Unfortunately, the effect does not persist after you close the window. Still quite a curious behavior.

### The nasty variant

What if you do not deselect any font and drag all fonts? Things get bad:

<center>
<a href="/assets/2025-01-12--windows-95-fonts/select-all-1.png">
<img src="/assets/2025-01-12--windows-95-fonts/select-all-1.png" alt="screenshot" width="640" border="1"/>
</a>
<figcaption>1. When you drag the fonts, the labels receive what appears to be Windows 3.1's sans serif font.</figcaption>
</center>

<img src="/assets/2025-01-12--windows-95-fonts/select-all-2.png" alt="screenshot" width="640" border="1"/>
</a>
<figcaption>2. Refreshing the window not only applies the font to all labels, but to the menus too. The effect expands to all windows, and even the title font is changed to a typeface I cannot recognize.</figcaption>
</center>

<img src="/assets/2025-01-12--windows-95-fonts/select-all-3.png" alt="screenshot" width="640" border="1"/>
</a>
<figcaption>3. The effect is permanent during the session. Opening new windows produces sometimes further anomalies: the menus are sometimes reduced to a series of “...” because their spacing is calculated accorging to the old font and hence insufficient, but they are moved to the correct position after refreshing the window.</figcaption>

### Some considerations

To showcase the phenomenon I have used the online VMs by [PCjs Explorer](https://www.pcjs.org/blog/2015/09/21/), but I vividly remember discovering it on my old Pentium 75, so it's not an emulator bug. I was able to reproduce the glitch also in [copy's website](https://copy.sh/v86/?profile=windows95), though the effect is less spectacular because the Internet Explorer addition running on his VM prevent the font change to appear in the menus. However, the fact that it works it further proves that it's not a fluke. The trick also works in the Win98 VMs. I have not tried further versions, but feel free to experiment and send me your results.

Now, why does this happen? If I had infinite time, I'd love to start a debugger and find out what messages are being sent, but this still would not solve the mystery of why this behavior was implemented in the first place. Since nobody is here to tell the story, here is my headcanon: 

* OS/2 supports changing font via drag and drop: see [this guide](https://www.os2world.com/wiki/index.php/User%27s_Guide_to_OS/2_Warp_Version_3_-_Part_3#Changing_Fonts).
* Someone at Microsoft got tasked with offering the same functionality for Win95.
* The feature got implemented, but it was found to be too brittle, or maybe confusing for users who just wanted to copy the font file to another folder and not change the typeface.
* The code section activating the font change when a “font file dropped” message was disabled, but they forgot to deactivate the trigger for the event “multiple font files dropped”. 

But this is just my theory. In particular, the strange effect shown by the nasty variant suggests that some out-of-bounds access is taking place.

I guess the real story will remain a mystery forever. Unless some Microsoft veteran lands by chance on these shores and wants to share the tale. Raymond Chen, are you by any chance reading? Please, don't keep us in the dark!
