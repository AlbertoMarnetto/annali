# Stunts

This page contains selected mods of Stunts (aka 4D Sports Driving), made by me and other fans. 

Note that most of the download links provide only the game executable; to run them one needs the full game. This was declared freeware by the original developers, and can be obtained in the [download section](https://wiki.stunts.hu/wiki/Download) of the Stunts Wiki.

## SuperSight

A mod increasing the field of view to a radius of up to 10 tiles around the car and drawing all objects in high resolution. For very crowded scenes, it automatically reduces the detail to avoid running out of memory. Additionally it adds a couple of functions:
* F5 turns on/off the display of the 3D engine status
* F6 turns on/off the visibility of [illusion tiles](https://wiki.stunts.hu/wiki/Illusion_track)

**Download:**
* <b>[SuperSight v1.5 – exe only](/assets/stunts/RESTUNTS-10a1e10.EXE)</b> (2025-02-11)
* <b>[SuperSight v1.5 – full game](/assets/stunts/restunts-complete.7z)</b> (2025-02-11)

## Stunts with binoculars

This mod, precursor of SuperSight, allows a slightly longer line of sight by sacrificing the side view, as described in my [writeup](/_posts/2025/02/20/broderbund-stunts-1.html). The result is much less impressive than what SuperSight can offer, so it is only left here for didactic purposes.
