## Stunts Modification Projects

This page contains my mods of DSI's Stunts (aka 4D Sports Driving). They are based on the [Restunts](https://wiki.stunts.hu/wiki/Restunts) project. I'll be discussing the changes (under my username HerrOtto) in [ZakStunts' forum](https://forum.stunts.hu/index.php?board=90.0).


### Stunts with binoculars

This mod allow a longer line of sight by sacrificing the side view. .

* [v1](./gamebino.v1.exe) : see [my post](https://forum.stunts.hu/index.php?topic=4400.msg96441#msg96441) for details
* [v2](./gamebino.v2.exe) : as above, but additionally use the high-detail model for all objects, not only for the near ones
